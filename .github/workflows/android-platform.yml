    name: Build Android APK
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code, including submodules
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: 'recursive' # Important for projects with submodules like PicaComic

      # Step 2: Set up Java Development Kit (JDK)
      # Flutter Android builds require Java. JDK 17 is used here.
      # PicaComic's AGP version (7.2.0 in android/build.gradle) officially recommends JDK 11.
      # While JDK 17 often works, if Gradle errors occur, changing this to '11' might be necessary.
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '17'

      # Step 3: Set up Flutter SDK and specific NDK version
      # Using a specific Flutter version based on pubspec.lock constraints.
      # The pubspec.lock file indicates flutter: ">=3.24.0".
      # We are using 3.24.0 here for consistency.
      # Explicitly setting NDK version 21.4.7075529 (NDK r21e) which bundles CMake 3.10.2.
      # Setting sdk-component-manager: false to force direct NDK download,
      # ensuring CMake 3.10.2 is correctly located within the NDK bundle.
      - name: Set up Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.24.0' # Aligned with pubspec.lock (flutter: ">=3.24.0")
          ndk-version: '21.4.7075529' # NDK r21e, includes CMake 3.10.2
          sdk-component-manager: false # Force direct NDK download for better CMake discovery

      # Step 4: Cache Flutter dependencies
      # This step speeds up builds by caching dependencies based on the pubspec.lock file.
      - name: Cache Flutter dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.pub-cache
            .dart_tool
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-flutter-${{ hashFiles('**/pubspec.lock') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-flutter-

      # Step 5: Get Flutter dependencies
      # This command fetches dependencies. It respects the pubspec.lock file
      # to ensure consistent dependency versions.
      - name: Get Flutter dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      # Step 6: Build Flutter APK (debug mode)
      # This command builds a debug APK.
      # The output APK will be located at build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
      - name: Build Debug APK
        run: flutter build apk --debug
        # To provide build number and version (less common for debug builds but possible):
        # run: flutter build apk --debug --build-name=${{ github.run_number }} --build-number=${{ github.run_number }}

      # Step 7: Rename the Debug APK (optional, for better artifact identification)
      # This makes the downloaded artifact name more descriptive.
      - name: Rename Debug APK
        run: mv build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk PicaComic-debug.apk

      # Step 8: Upload Debug APK artifact
      # This step uploads the built debug APK as an artifact, which you can download from the workflow run page.
      - name: Upload Debug APK Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: PicaComic-debug-apk # Name of the artifact bundle in GitHub
          path: PicaComic-debug.apk # Path to the file to upload
          if-no-files-found: error # Fail the workflow if the APK is not found
