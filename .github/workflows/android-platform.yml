# YAML Workflow for Building an Android Debug APK for a Flutter Project

name: Build Flutter Android Debug APK

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Or your development branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master # Or your development branch
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering

jobs:
  build_android_apk:
    name: Build Android Debug APK
    runs-on: windows-latest # Or macos-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Project Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # This step checks out your repository's code.

      - name: Set up Flutter SDK
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.24.0' # Specify your desired Flutter version.
          channel: 'stable' # Or 'beta', 'dev', 'master'
        # This action sets up the Flutter environment.

      - name: Display Flutter version
        run: flutter --version
        # Verifies Flutter is installed correctly.

      - name: Verify Android SDK Setup (via flutter doctor)
        run: flutter doctor
        # Checks if the Android SDK and other dependencies are correctly set up for Flutter.

      - name: Get Flutter Dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
        # Fetches all the dependencies listed in pubspec.yaml.

      - name: Clean Flutter Project (Optional but Recommended)
        run: flutter clean
        # Cleans the build cache.

      - name: Build Android Debug APK
        run: flutter build apk --debug
        # This is the core command to build the debug APK.
        # The --debug flag specifies a debug build.

      - name: Upload APK Artifact (Optional)
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: app-debug-apk
          path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
          if-no-files-found: error # Fails the workflow if the APK is not found
        # This step uploads the generated APK as an artifact,
        # making it available for download from the GitHub Actions run.

      - name: Notify Build Status (Example - further setup required for actual notifications)
        if: always() # Ensures this step runs even if previous steps fail
        run: |
          echo "Build status: ${{ job.status }}"
          echo "APK (if successful) is available in artifacts or at build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk"
        # A simple notification step. For real notifications, integrate with services like Slack, email, etc.

# General Information and Prerequisites (as comments, not executable):
#
# Prerequisites (to be ensured in the runner environment or by setup steps):
#   1. Flutter SDK Installed: Handled by 'subosito/flutter-action'.
#   2. Android Studio / Android SDK: Generally included in GitHub-hosted runners or needs to be set up.
#      'flutter doctor' helps verify this.
#   3. Project Code: Handled by 'actions/checkout'.
#
# Steps from the Markdown workflow mapped to this YAML:
#   1. Navigate to Project Directory: Implicitly handled by the runner starting in the project root.
#   2. Ensure Dependencies are Up-to-Date: 'flutter pub get' step.
#   3. Check Connected Devices/Emulators: Not applicable for CI build; primarily for local development.
#   4. Build the Debug APK: 'flutter build apk --debug' step.
#   5. Locate the APK: Path is 'build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk'. Uploaded as an artifact.
#   6. Install the APK (Optional): Not typically done in CI for just building. For UI testing,
#      you would add steps to run on an emulator/device.
#
# Important Notes:
#   - Android Manifest & Gradle: Configurations in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
#     and `android/app/build.gradle` are used by the `flutter build` command.
#   - Signing: Debug APKs are auto-signed with a debug key.
#   - Build Flavors/Modes: If your project uses flavors, modify the build command:
#     `flutter build apk --debug --flavor <flavorName>`
#   - Troubleshooting: Check the logs from each step in the GitHub Actions run.
